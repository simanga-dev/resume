Please update my resume in `@main.tex` to align perfectly with the requirements in `@job-description.md`.

**Resume Updates:**
1.  **Objective:** Rewrite it to explicitly state I have **6 years of experience** (replace 'Mid-Level') and highlight .NET ecosystem, Web APIs, and SQL Server skills.
2.  **Experience:** Tailor the bullet points to emphasize skills found in the job description (e.g., SaaS, CI/CD, Enterprise systems).
3.  **Formatting:** Adjust the page margins to **1.5 cm** and ensure the content fits strictly onto **two pages**.

**Execution:**
1.  Apply these changes to `main.tex`.
2.  Run `make` to build the final PDF and verify it compiles successfully.

**Email Draft:**
1.  Extract the hiring email address from the job description.
2.  Write a professional cover letter email based on the updated resume and job requirements.
3.  Use the `gmail_draft_email` tool to create a draft to that address with the subject 'Application for Permanent Mid-Level C# Developer – Simanga Khoza', the cover letter as the body, and the **compiled PDF attached**.
