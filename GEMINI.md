# Project Overview

This project contains a resume written in LaTeX. The resume is tailored for a Front-End Developer position, as described in `job-description.md`. The main resume file is `main.tex`, and it is compiled into a PDF using the `Makefile`.

# Building and Running

To build the resume, run the following command:

```bash
make build
```

This will generate a PDF file named `simanga_h_khoza_cv_complete.pdf`.

To clean up the auxiliary files generated during the build process, run:

```bash
make clean
```

# Development Conventions

The resume is written in LaTeX. To make changes, edit the `main.tex` file and then rebuild the project.
